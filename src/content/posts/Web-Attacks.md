Hey guys!

As developers, we're always looking for ways to keep our applications safe from hackers and cyber criminals. In this article, we’ll dive into some of the most common web attacks, how they work, and, most importantly, how to prevent them.

## 1. SQL Injection

SQL injection is one of the oldest and most common web attacks. It occurs when an attacker injects malicious code into your database to steal sensitive information or gain unauthorized access.

- **How it works:** An attacker inserts a malicious SQL query into a vulnerable web form or parameter, allowing them to manipulate the database and access sensitive data.
    
- **Example:** Imagine a login form where someone enters a username like `admin OR 1=1`. If the input isn’t properly sanitized, the database might return all user records, including sensitive details like passwords.
    
- **How to avoid it:** Use prepared statements and parameterized queries. Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection.
    

## 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS attacks happen when an attacker injects malicious client-side scripts into your website, potentially stealing user data, hijacking sessions, or spreading malware.

- **How it works:** Malicious JavaScript is embedded into a web page, which is then executed by unsuspecting users when they visit the page.
    
- **Example:** Imagine a comment section that doesn’t validate input. An attacker posts a comment containing harmful JavaScript, which runs when another user views the comment, compromising their session or data.
    
- **How to avoid it:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script sources and use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious activity.
    

## 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CSRF tricks users into performing actions they didn’t intend on a trusted website, like transferring money or changing account details.

- **How it works:** An attacker sends a malicious request that tricks a logged-in user into performing an action on their behalf.
    
- **Example:** A user clicks on a seemingly innocent link, which secretly submits a form to transfer funds from their account.
    
- **How to avoid it:** Implement CSRF tokens to validate legitimate requests, validate user inputs rigorously, and use a WAF to block suspicious activities.
    

## 4. Brute Force Attacks

Brute force attacks involve repeatedly trying different password combinations until the correct one is found.

- **How it works:** Automated tools are used to systematically guess a password until they succeed.
    
- **Example:** A site without rate limiting allows an attacker to try millions of password combinations until they crack the admin password.
    
- **How to avoid it:** Use rate limiting, CAPTCHAs, and IP blocking. Encourage users to create strong, unique passwords and enforce password complexity requirements.
    

## 5. Directory Traversal

Directory traversal attacks occur when attackers manipulate URL paths to access restricted files and directories.

- **How it works:** An attacker alters the URL to navigate through directories, potentially accessing sensitive files.
    
- **Example:** By entering something like [`http://example.com/../../../../etc/password`](http://example.com/../../../../etc/password), an attacker tries to access a server’s password file.
    
- **How to avoid it:** Always validate and sanitize file paths. Restrict access to sensitive directories and use a WAF to block malicious requests.
    

## 6. Command Injection

Command injection happens when an attacker injects system commands into a vulnerable application, gaining unauthorized access or control.

- **How it works:** Malicious commands are inserted into a web application, which then executes them on the server.
    
- **Example:** A file upload feature allows an attacker to upload a script that runs commands, compromising the server.
    
- **How to avoid it:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs, especially in file uploads. Ensure that uploaded files are securely handled and use a WAF to detect malicious commands.
    

## 7. File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

These attacks involve injecting malicious code into a web application, leading to the execution of arbitrary files.

- **How it works:** Attackers exploit file inclusion mechanisms to run unauthorized scripts.
    
- **Example:** A vulnerable website might let an attacker include a malicious PHP file, which then runs with the application’s privileges.
    
- **How to avoid it:** Strictly validate and sanitize file paths and user inputs. Ensure that only trusted files are included and use a WAF to block suspicious activities.
    

## 8. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

A DDoS attack overwhelms a website with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

- **How it works:** A botnet floods the site with traffic, overloading the server and causing it to crash or slow down.
    
- **Example:** A website becomes unreachable after a massive wave of traffic from thousands of compromised devices.
    
- **How to avoid it:** Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and DDoS protection services to absorb and mitigate traffic spikes. Ensure your servers are configured to handle high traffic volumes. A good tip is using services like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) or [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/), which offer built-in DDoS protection.
    

## 9. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)

MitM attacks involve intercepting communication between two parties, often to steal data or inject malware.

- **How it works:** An attacker intercepts and potentially alters the data exchanged between a user and a website.
    
- **Example:** An attacker intercepts login credentials being sent from a user to a website, gaining unauthorized access.
    
- **How to avoid it:** Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to secure communications. Many hosting providers, like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), offer built-in SSL certificates, making it easy to secure your site. Ensure users verify website authenticity, and consider using a VPN to encrypt all internet traffic.
