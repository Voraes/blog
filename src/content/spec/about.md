### Hey! 

I'm **Victor**, a software engineer, music lover and bookworm with a passion for creating meaningful and impactful things that serve everyone.

When I’m not coding or writing, you might find me exploring a trail, getting lost in a good book, enjoying timeless tunes, or diving into something new. I’m always up for a chat, so feel free to reach out. Let's connect and share some ideas!
